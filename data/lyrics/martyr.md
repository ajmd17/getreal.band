Crack in your spine
Lump in your throat
Wrapped up in white like a ghost in silky sheets
But what lies beneath?

Speaking in tongues
Hand-me-down lies
Pure like the virgin but with holes cut for her eyes
And you say you speak from peace?

Organized crime in a legal way
It's god's favorite day to come out to play
And smite thee in thy place!

They hold my head below the water
The visions they have conjured
Are like an anchor to my feet

They led you down into the basement slaughter
With your hands tied to the altar
The sheered you like a sheep

They bled you out, as your eyes begin to falter
I will be your martyr
Baby, I will die for you
One day they'll face the truth

Silence young one, your thoughts are too loud
Give me your word, not a word of this gets out
You better take this to your grave

P-p-pray pray pray for your purity
I tried to repent but I couldn't keep it clean
Oh won't you exorcise me?

They hold my head below the water
The visions they have conjured
Are like an anchor to my feet

They led you down into the basement slaughter
With your hands tied to the altar
The sheered you like a sheep

They bled you out, as your eyes begin to falter
I will be your martyr
Baby, I will die for you
One day they'll face the truth

Well pray pray pray for your purity
I tried to repent but I couldn't keep it clean
Say, pray pray pray for your purity
You're better off dead with the fires beneath your feet
Bring me down, bring me to my knees

I feel them hold my head below the water
The visions they have conjured
Are like an anchor to my feet

They led you down into the basement slaughter
With your hands tied to the altar
The sheered you like a sheep

They bled you out, as your eyes begin to falter
I will be your martyr
Baby, I will die for you
One day they'll face the truth
