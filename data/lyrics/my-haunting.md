Late nights in my haunted house
Have never felt so lonely
It’s been quiet as a mouse

No one ever hangs around
They’ve all left me for dead
They never dust away my gravestone spiderwebs

Don’t you tell me what I want you to say
Just take two steps back and walk away

You are my haunting, my haunting is you
You always dissipate when I look for you
I might be a monster
But that’s just cause I’m feeling blue

From the cradle to the grave
I will walk with the unsaved
With a smile on my face

And with my undead mass appeal
My selfish charm and heart of steel
I’ll shelter you from storm

Don’t you tell me what I want you to say
Just take two steps back and walk away

You are my haunting, my haunting is you
You always dissipate when I look for you
I might be a monster
But that’s just cause I’m feeling blue

Well, you are my haunting, my haunting is you
You always dissipate when I look for you
I might be a monster
But that’s just cause I’m feeling blue
