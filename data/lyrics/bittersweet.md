Pleased to meet you
Let me get my story straight
They try to keep me in the dark
But what difference does it make

They couldn't fix me
So they let me slip away
I am burdened with uncertainty
And that certainly won't change

I stand watching days go by
I don't need you by my side

Hold the mic and let me hear you call my name
There is no one left to blame now but yourself
Congratulations was the icing on the cake
A piece of you, a piece of me, and we will be
We'll be bittersweet

They hold my head down
Sticking needles in my gums
I'm in need of medication
Acid wash my silver tongue

The taste of freedom
Is a goddamn boring one at that
I'd rather spend the evening reeling
Getting high on laughing gas

I stand watching days go by
I don't need you here tonight

Hold the mic and let me hear you call my name
There is no one left to blame now but yourself
Congratulations was the icing on the cake
A piece of you, a piece of me, and we will be
We'll be bittersweet

I stand watching days go by
I don't need you this time

Hold the mic and let me hear you call my name
There is no one left to blame now but yourself
Congratulations was the icing on the cake
A piece of you, a piece of me, and we will be
We'll be bittersweet
