Well, we set fire to the sacred gates
Watched the good book go up in flames
It never meant much to me
Self-righteous prophecy
To pray on our fears of being alone

But we won't be a punching bag for your school of thought
And you can't expect us to behave when we're left to rot
And I think I know my place and where I stand
I stand in the middle of the riot with a Molotov in my hand

Oh lord, we'll drown the daylight with smoke and song
We won't stop 'till the feelings gone

But we won't be a punching bag for your school of thought
And you can't expect us to behave when we're left to rot
And I think I know my place and where I stand
I stand in the middle of the riot with a Molotov in my hand

Drown the daylight with smoke and song
We won't stop 'till the feelings gone

But we won't be a punching bag for your school of thought
And you can't expect us to behave when we're left to rot
And I think I know my place and where I stand
I stand in the middle of the riot with a Molotov in my hand
