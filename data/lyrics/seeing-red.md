They say it's got a hold on me
I just can't accept it
My sweet tooth is worse than I expected, oh no

I think I’ve got the hang of this
A little more and I will get my fix
Keep my nose cleaned and leave it behind

And I go, and I go, and I go my way (x2)
And I try to let it go

Hey! A little help in here
Hey! I wanna disappear
Let me take control and bring me back to life

Hey! A little help in here
Make my vision crystal clear
I’m tired of seeing red and I wanna take control
Cause I’ve got to let it go before it takes a toll
On me

I made a promise I can’t keep
My will is far too weak
A seed of something so deeply buried inside
My soul

And I go, and I go, and I go my way (x2)
And I try to let it go

Hey! A little help in here
Hey! I wanna disappear
Let me take control and bring me back to life

Hey! A little help in here
Make my vision crystal clear
I’m tired of seeing red and I wanna take control
Gotta let it go before it takes a toll on me, yeah

I’m on the run and I can’t look back
Gotta let it go, gotta let it slide
I wanna run and I can’t look back, oh no
I’m on the run and I can’t look back
Gotta let it go, gotta let it slide
I wanna run, I’ll run, I’ll run, yeah

Hey! A little help in here
Hey! I wanna disappear
Let me take control and bring me back to life

Hey! A little help in here
Make my vision crystal clear
I’m tired of seeing red and I wanna take control
Gotta let it go before it takes a toll on me
And I’m doing what I can took keep my spirit clean
