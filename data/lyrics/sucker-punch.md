I lie awake in bed at night
Over-thinking things I’ve said
Was stupid a’ me to run my mouth
What was I thinking, half-believing you care

You brush me off so easily
You’re gonna leave me in the dust
I’m sinking in the quicksand, tell me
What does it feel like walking on air?

Feeling like I'm old in my youth
Cause my cracked spine can’t seem to face the truth

Maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Maybe I’m just dreaming I'm something I’ll never be

Maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Or maybe, I’m a sucker for you

Now that we’re on the mend
I won’t forget to take my meds
So I just empty the bottle
All over the floor

Those demons won't come 'round no more

I’m as tattered as the holes in my jeans
My nerves are worn and tattered all stitched at the seams!

Maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Maybe I’m just dreaming I'm something I’ll never be

Maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Or maybe, I’m a sucker for you

And this winter’s been so c-c-c-cold...
Like your fall from grace, where you lost all control
Don't get me wrong
I would fall if you let me cause you’re always out to get me

So just sink your teeth into me, bite down and chew to the bone!
I'll drive to the city and break down the door of your home!

Well it hurts when it's over
Got me crying on your shoulder
Hopin' you won't be leaving too long
Well, I'm a sucker, and you knew it all along

I said maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Maybe I’m just dreaming I'm something I’ll never be

Maybe I’m a freak
Maybe I’m naive
Or maybe, I’m a sucker for you
I said maybe, oh maybe it's the truth
Maybe, I’m a sucker
Maybe I'm a sucker, ohhhh
Maybe I'm a sucker for you
