You hang me out to dry
You leave me in the cold
You know, it's getting old

But I know you're not to blame
We give and then we take
But one always ends with more

I better watch my back
My heart is always under attack
Just when I get back on my feet
I slip through the cracks

Tell me what you wanna hear
Give me that sweet talk in my ear
Never gonna see the light of day
If you don't stand up and walk away

Because darkness is a friend of mine
The only one but that's alright
Never gonna see the light of day
I'm never gonna see the light

Hey you, you got me strung out again
You're leaving me a tattered mess
Some things they never change

Well I don't wanna be a fool
You know you play me like a card
But this king has lost his crown

Take me for it all
Yeah, everything I am
You're always playing dirty
I see the knife that's in your hand

Tell me what you wanna hear
Give me that sweet talk in my ear
Never gonna see the light of day
If you don't stand up and walk away

Because darkness is a friend of mine
The only one but that's alright
Never gonna see the light of day
I'm never gonna see the light

I think you know very well
Just who I am
No I will not be mistaken

My heart is always on my sleeve
It always gets the best of me
I think you know very well

Won't you just tell me what you wanna hear
Give me that sweet talk in my ear
Never gonna see the light of day
If you don't stand up and walk away

Because darkness is a friend of mine
The only one and that is why
I'm never gonna see the light of day
I'm never gonna see the light
